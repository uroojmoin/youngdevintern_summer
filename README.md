Task 1 : Develop a Neural Network for Classification
Task: Build and train a neural network.
Details:
Use TensorFlow or PyTorch to create a neural network for a classification task.
Train the model and evaluate its performance on a test set.

Task 2 : Implement Hyperparameter Tuning
Task: Optimize model hyperparameters.
Details:
Use tools like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for a model.
Evaluate the impact of different hyperparameters on model performance

Task 3 : Preprocess Data for Machine Learning
Task: Clean and prepare data for modeling.
Details:
Handle missing values, normalize features, and encode categorical variables using scikit-learn.
Split data into training and testing sets.
